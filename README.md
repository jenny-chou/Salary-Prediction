# Salary Prediction Project
## Define problem
In sites such as Glassdoor, LinkedIn, and Indeed, each job lists its required skills, education, qualification, experience, and of course, salary. 
* For applicants, instead of accepting the salary employer proposed on site, having an estimator predicting the salary based on job requirements or skills acquired gives confidence of their worth for further negotiation. 
* For employer, an salary estimator suggests a market standard so employers can propose a reasonable salary to attract more applicates. 

Thus the goal of this project is given jobs with categories of requirements, create an model that estimates a salary.
